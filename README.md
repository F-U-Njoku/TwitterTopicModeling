# TwitterTopicModeling
Access to the Internet is becoming more affordable especially in Africa and with this the
number of active social media users is also on the rise. Twitter is a social media platform
on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". These tweets are
usually short with a limit of 280 characters. With over 100 million Internet users and 6
million active monthly users in Nigeria, lots of data is generated through this medium
daily. This thesis aims to gain insights from the ever-growing Nigerian data generated
from twitter using Topic modelling. We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on Nigerian
heath tweets from verified accounts covering time period of 2015 â€“ 2019 to derive top
health topics in Nigeria. We detected the outbreaks of Ebola, Lassa fever and meningitis
within this time frame. We also detected reoccurring topics of child
immunization/vaccination. Twitter data contains useful information that can give insights
to individuals, organizations and the government hence it should be further explored and
utilized.
